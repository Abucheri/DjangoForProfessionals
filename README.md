## Django for Professionals - 2.2

### By: William S. Vincent

This repository will contain project solution for the book Django for Professionals.

I have used Django version `3.1.1` for the entire book.

### Bookstore Project

The final project, Bookstore, is deployed on Heroku at [https://aqueous-hollows-72604.herokuapp.com/](https://aqueous-hollows-72604.herokuapp.com/).

### My review

Django for Professionals is definitely a must read. Topics are conveyed in very easy to understand manner. This book shows how developers approach a problem and how to look for solutions.

This, however, is not a definitive guide. I got only some glimpse of advance topics but for a beginner its a good start.
